[h1]Masochist Mode EX[/h1]

[h2]Information[/h2]
This is a Fargo's Souls Mod add-on that turns the game into a truly hellish experience. It currently has no rewards. You subject yourself to pain entirely for its sake.
No toggle item is needed to activate Masochist Mode EX in a world - just install, reload, and play.
